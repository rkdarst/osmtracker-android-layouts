Surfrider Foundation Europe uses OSMTracker to collect data on  macroplastics pollution in rivers. Then, the point is to add a colour  scale on every rivers on a map. Therefore, we will be able to have an  idea about the pollution of every rivers and to take measures according  to the map but also to raise awareness.
