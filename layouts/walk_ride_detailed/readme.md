Walk Ride Detailed
============

This layout is intended for users updating in detail paths, tracks, cycleways and other routes which are normally travelled on foot, wheelchair, horse or cycle.

Hopefully with the aid of this layout you will be able to survey the route and gain enough information in the form of geo-referenced notes, recordings and photographs to allow you to update OpenStreetMap to a high standard.  

Button sets or pages  
--------------------

The button sets should assist you with surveying such features as a 'track' which is used by farm vehicles, but is also a Public Right of Way (UK probably), designated as a **footpath**.  
**Button sets include**;  

*  **LOOKS LIKE** - allows you to chose what the feature looks like, such as a track or a path.  
*  **DESIGNATION** - if signed, allows you to note the designation displayed.  
*  **ACCESS** - Who is allowed such as foot=yes, bike=no.  
*  **SURFACE** - Asphalt, gravel, grass, etc..  
*  **BARRIER** - Bollards, gates, kissing-gates, stiles, etc..  
*  **VARIOUS** - Is it lit? Are dogs allowed, are there dog-poo bins? Bench & information boards.  
*  **WIDTH** - 9 buttons of different options.    
*  **SOLAR -ERRORS** - Roof PV panels and orientation, and 'Errors' for those moments when you took the wrong fork and want to have a note of this.  
*  **TRACKTYPE** - Buttons for each of the grades. 
*  **SMOOTHNESS** - Buttons for each grade, with an indication as to you should tag it as.

Tip - when recording info concerning roof PV panels, the top left of the osmtracker screen will show the direction you are moving in degrees, starting at North being 0 or 360 degrees. If the roof panel is orientated at a half angle, consider using two buttons, so that North East is represented by the North button (315-44), followed by the East Button (45-134)
There is one spare button - if you would something added, contact the author at (Nick-Tallguy)[https://github.com/Nick-Tallguy/osmtracker-android-layouts]
